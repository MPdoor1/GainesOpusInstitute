# Gaines Opus Institute Current

This is a project I am working on by myself. 

At the time I am writing this, it is 11/11/2022 and have been on this project for about seven months. 

I have gone through multiple languages and structures, but have been slowly shaping this massive puzzle to be a marble statue. 

It honestly has felt like walking through mud, so please enjoy the product.
